script:
- git checkout ${TRAVIS_BRANCH}
# we do not measure test coverage (since this repo has no main code)
- cd EmbeddedMontiArc && mvn clean install --settings "settings.xml"

# we do not publish the tagging example examples (this repo does not contain any productive code, only test examples how to use tagging)
