The magnitude and quantity of software projects rises constantly, as software development needs spread among scientific and technical disciplines. Since not all languages are suitable for all occasions and others may provide too much features to be efficient for a specific purpose, Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) are developed. DSLs are languages tailored specifically to a certain objective.
EmbeddedMontiArc, a specific DSL for cyber-physical systems is evaluated in this paper. It will be introduced in more detail in section \ref{} together with the used tools. This section forms a general introduction and will present the research questions.
Thereafter the approach will be presented in section \ref{}. Section \ref{} depicts the simulator integration and the developed models. In section \ref{} the evaluation is presented, concluded by a conclusion in section \ref{}.

\subsection{Research Questions}
In the following the scope of this paper will be presented by formulating the research questions.
\begin{itemize}
	\item RQ1: Is EmbeddedMontiArc suitable for other systems?
	\item RQ2: Is it possible to integrate other simulators in a recent amount of work?
	\item RQ3: What kind of background knowledge is needed to model C\&C in EMA?
	\item RQ4: What features are good and what are not suited?
\end{itemize}
