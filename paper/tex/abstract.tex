(Abstract by Philipp Haller)
The magnitude and quantity of software projects rises constantly, as software development needs spread among scientific and technical disciplines. Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) show to provide solutions for specialized contexts. EmbeddedMontiArc is a DSL for cyber physical systems.
This paper represents a case-study, evaluating the ease of use and re-usability of EmbeddedMontiArc for reactive systems by presenting models for the games Pacman and Supermario. Games are highly reactive systems were entities controlled by the player react to a changing environment and try to reach goals, thus can provide a good testing ground for actual systems.
From the models presented it is concluded that EmbeddedMontiArc is suitable for cyber-physical systems, but still not flawless.
