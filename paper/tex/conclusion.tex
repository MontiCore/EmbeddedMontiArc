In this paper, the question after the suitability of the DSL EmbeddedMontiArc for other systems different from the autopilot project is answered. For that reason the four research questions mentioned in the beginning were formulated. Those questioned are approached by assigning two groups the task to model a controller for the two real-time problems \textit{Pacman} and \textit{Supermario}.
After successful modeling the development experience was condensed and presented. It showed that EmbeddedMontiArc as a language is suitable and intuitive, while the integrated development environment used and some bugs did cost a lot of time.
Given a modern development environment is used, EmbeddedMontiArc has great potential towards reactive cyber-physical systems.
