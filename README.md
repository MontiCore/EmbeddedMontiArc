# Commons
This repository includes the interfaces and general functionality for the other repositories.

It should be noted that this repository should not have any dependencies on the other repositories - instead all other repositories are allowed to have this repository as dependency.

# Data exchange: Vehicle Controller
Constant values in the `BusEntry.java` class file are required for the exchange of data between the simulation and the controller.

For example, new available sensors need to be included here.
