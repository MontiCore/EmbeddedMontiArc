# LTSAutopilot
LTSAutopilot is applied for the decisions in cooperative driving scenarios. Current project is supported with Smartfoxserver 2X, which provides JavaScript API for the data exchange of visualization.

# Installation of SmartFoxServer 2X
Running the complete simulation platform with current LTSAutopilot requires deployment of the visualization and server repository deliverables to an installed SmartFoxServer 2X. The [Installision of SmartFoxServer 2X](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/monticore/EmbeddedMontiArc/simulators/server?nav_source=navbar) and the [Configuration of Database Service](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/monticore/EmbeddedMontiArc/simulators/server?nav_source=navbar) have been already introduced in server project. 


# Generation of Autopilotadapter

# Deploy of Autopilotadapter in RMIMODELServer

# Running scenario 
Several scenarios are listed in the folder _scenario examples_ , the simulation file and map file should be uploaded at the same time. After that the simulation can be started, and the scenario will be visualized.
 _Aachen.osm_ is the common map for these scenarios, it's defined in the area near Forckenbeckstraße and Pauwelsstraße in Aachen.
# Possible improvement of model language in future
