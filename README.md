# EMACodeBERT
The goal of this thesis is to implement the network described in the paper on CodeBERT in CNNArch2Gluon

# Repository Structure
`conversion` contains scripts pertaining to CodeBERT huggingface to GluonNLP conversion


`packaging` contains scripts pretaining to using the [emadl-maven-plugin](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/monticore/EmbeddedMontiArc/utilities/emadl-maven-plugin) to package the model from the conversion
