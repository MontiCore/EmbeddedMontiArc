The current version for gluon is located in gluon-cpp wich uses the newest EMADL2CPP generator (v0.4.1, this is also the version located in this repository) with a full CPP MXNet/Gluon api, rather than the old c prediction api for inference which can be found in the gluon-old and mxnet folders.

## Prerequisites
1. Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS or 18.04 LTS (experimental)
2. Deep Learning Framework **Caffe2**. [Follow the instructions from this link](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/monticore/EmbeddedMontiArc/generators/CNNArch2Caffe2#ubuntu).
3. Deep Learning Framework **MXNet/Gluon**.
4. Deep Learning Framework **Tensorflow**.
4. Armadillo (at least armadillo version 6.600 must be used) [Official instructions at Armadillo Website](http://arma.sourceforge.net/download.html).
4. OpenCV


## MXNet/Gluon, Tensorflow and Caffe2
For detailed instructions on how to run the MXNet/Gluon, Tensorflow and Caffe2 examples, see the README in the corresponding folders.
