## Description
**Sol** (from the Latin word for sun) is an infrastructure for the generation of IDEs for DSLs and their tools. The name
of this project comes from an analogy: as much as the rays of the sun shine to every corner of a room, so does the
distributed nature of this infrastructure cover every repository holding artifacts which augment the functionality of
the resulting IDE.
