# SimulationLanguage

SimLang is a DSL for describing settings of vehicle simulations.
In order to do so it utilizes UnitNumbers from NumberUnit and the Weather language.

SimLang files must end with .sim.

To use car models created with the [Car Modeling Language](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/monticore/EmbeddedMontiArc/simulators/CarLang), they have to be imported in the preamble of the sim file and need to be placed in their corresponding location in the model path. Then, when the scenario file is parsed, the corresponding car files will automatically loaded and are accessible from the `SimLangContainer` via the `getCarContainer()` method of the class `ExplicitVehicle`. 

## Syntax help
```
"" terms are keywords.
| denotes choices.
[]-parenthesised terms are variable input.
()? are optional inputs.
Uppercase terms relate to another rule.
```

**See the scenarios folder or test resources for examples.**

#### untilGoal = metricGoal1 "until" metricGoal2;
#### metricName = ["speed"|"acceleration"|"batteryLevel"];
Creates a vehicle or a platoon. A vehicle will spawn at the first way point defined in its path attribute(sartLat, startLong).
If "platoon" is given, the rest vehicles will spawn following the leading vehicle. Their destinations are reached if the leading
vehicle reached its destination and they still stay in the platoon. The initial rotation can be specified using the keyword "rotation".
A vehicle can have multiple "goals", they can be used to describe which conditions must be fufilled before the simulation ends.
Each condition should be given a type: "never", "always", "eventually" or "until".
The type "until"(untilGoal) is special, its basic form is: cond1 "until" cond2, meaning cond1 should be true until cond2 is true.
It can be used to test scenarios like: 
an EV should not release too much power if battery level is low, otherwise it might damage the battery("batteryLevel" ">" 0.3 "until" "acceleration" ">" 25 km/s^2);
a vehicle should stay still before the traffic light turns green("speed" "==" 0 km/s "until" "green").

  CHANNEL_RULE1 ";"
  CHANNEL_RULE2 ";"
"}"
