## Coding Conventions
The code of this repository follows certain coding conventions. In order for the developer to not learn these
conventions by heart, [**TSLint**](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) has been used to make developers aware of
violations in the TypeScript code. Similarly, [**SonarLint**](https://www.sonarlint.org/) has been used for the Java
code.
