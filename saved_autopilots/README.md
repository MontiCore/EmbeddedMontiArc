# Sin-Cos-Angle Representation Experiment

## Description
This experiment will be used to compare the representation of orientations as sine and cosine values to the old representation using a single interval in degrees.

In this experiment, a single vehicle will learn to follow a path, without the use of any preprocessor.

## Goal
The training goal of the autopilot is to follow a given path as closely and as fast as possible, without causing any collisions.

## Research Goal
This experiment is expected to perform better than the minimal driving experiment, which represents orientations using a single value. So the goal of this experiment is to get some result after training until the loss-functions stabilize. After getting such constant results, we can compare the results of this experiment with the minimal driving experiment.

## Pass Criteria
Given the research goal, this experiment is considered passed, if the vehicle will drive in some fashion after the loss-function stabilizes.
