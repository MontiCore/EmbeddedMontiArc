# Artifact Contribution Language

## Description
This module consists of the files of the Artifact Contribution Language (ACL) which is used to describe artifacts to be
made known to the generated IDE. To this end, it distinguishes between **Artifact**, **Tool**, and **Virtual Tool**
models. The latter two are used to make tools known to the IDE. A tool model refers to an executable tool which is
located in the same repository as the model whereas a virtual tool model refers to an already installed tool of the
execution environment.
