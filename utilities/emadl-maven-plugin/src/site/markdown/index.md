# EMADL Maven Plugin

The **EMADL Maven Plugin** provides custom goals to package and deploy or install 
various aspects of an **E**mbedded**M**onti**A**rc **D**eep **L**earning project 
as a JAR file. Additonally to the *deploy* and *install* goals, 
it provides a goal to train an EMADL component containing a neural network 
implementation and a goal to import EMADL components and training configuration
once they are packaged.  

The code can be found in the [GitLab repository](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/monticore/EmbeddedMontiArc/utilities/emadl-maven-plugin), 
along with some examples on how to use the *emadl-maven-plugin*.
