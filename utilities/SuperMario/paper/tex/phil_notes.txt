#INTRODUCTION


The data collected in an empirical study may be quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative
data involves numbers and classes, while qualitative data involves words, descriptions,
pictures, diagrams etc. Quantitative data is analyzed using statistics, while qualitative data is
analyzed using categorization and sorting. Case studies tend mostly to be based on qualitative
data, as these provide a richer and deeper description. However, a combination of qualitative
and quantitative data often provides better understanding of the studied phenomenon
(Seaman 1999), i.e. what is sometimes called “mixed methods” (Robson 2002).

Perry et al. define similar criteria for a case study (Perry et al. 2005). It is expected that a
case study:
& “Has research questions set out from the beginning of the study
& Data is collected in a planned and consistent manner
& Inferences are made from the data to answer the research question
& Explores a phenomenon, or produces an explanation, description, or causal analysis of it
& Threats to validity are addressed in a systematic way.”
