See [] for a video on how to setup a project from the MontiCar language family.

A short step-by-step guide:
1. Clone the git repository of the project you want to work on.
2. Copy the settings.xml from [https://github.com/EmbeddedMontiArc/external-dependencies/blob/master/settings.xml] 
   and put it into your maven home(This is usually "C:\Users\<name>\.m2", unless you changed the location by altering your maven settings).
3. Now you can open the project in your favorite IDE(IntelliJ for example) and use maven from there(if you want to). 
4. Now `mvn install` can be used to install the project.
