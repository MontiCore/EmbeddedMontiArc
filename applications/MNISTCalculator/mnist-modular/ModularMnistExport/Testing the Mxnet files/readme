This folder holds replacement files to test the Mxnet Export
files generated by executing the main project "ModularMnistExport".

Simply replace the POM, the file src/emadl/calculator/MnistInputLayer.emadl
LOCALLY and put the model folder (from this directory) to the project directory.
Now the dockerfile will test the transfer model instead.

The changes that will happen with the substitution are as follows:
The model is no longer considered a decomposition model. (from the POM)
The input layer imports itself by .json and .params files. (from the emadl file)
The Mxnet files of the model are accessible. (from the model folder)
