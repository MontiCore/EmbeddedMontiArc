# Hardware Emulator

## >> [Link to the MontiSim Documentation (Wiki)](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/monticore/EmbeddedMontiArc/simulators/simulation/-/wikis/home)  <<

The Issues for MontiSim are tracked in the [simulation project](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/monticore/EmbeddedMontiArc/simulators/simulation/-/boards/8343).

## Usage

To use the different sub-project as maven dependency, add the following to your pom's `<dependencies>`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>montisim</groupId>
    <artifactId>hardware_emulator</artifactId>
    <version>${version}</version>
</dependency>
```

## Developing

Make sure to clone this repository recursively!

```bash
git clone --recursive https://git.rwth-aachen.de/monticore/EmbeddedMontiArc/simulators/hardware_emulator
# If you already have the cloned repository without the sub-module, you can add it with:
git submodule update --init
```


## Overview

This project allows to run **EmbeddedMontiArc** models that have a **DynamicInterface** and let them communicate with the MontiSim simulation. It allows the time evaluation of the model execution using a parametric computer model.

## Building

The project contains a **C++ CMake project** and a **Maven project**. 
The C++ project contains the logic of the Hardware Emulator.
The Maven project takes this C++ library and wraps it in a Jar alongside its Java Interfaces. The resulting Jar is avaiable as dependency in the **nexus**.

### C++ Project

To compile the C++ project (under the [hardware_emulator](hardware_emulator) folder), use the `build_emulator` script for your system (located in the [scripts](scripts) folder).

> For Visual Studio, the script has to be started inside the Visual Studio **Developer Command Prompt**.
> 
> With Visual Studio, the library can also be compiled directly from within the Visual Studio project generated by CMake (in the `build` folder).

The `build_emulator` script will directly install the compiled library inside the [resources](src/main/resources) folder of the Maven project.

_**NOTE:** When changing the version of the maven project, be sure to set the version accordingly in [software_simulator_manager.h](hardware_emulator/src/software_simulator_manager.h). This ensures that the library included in the artifact is up-to-date with the Java code._

### Maven Project

Simply use the `mvn install` command in the main directory to compile the maven project. 

> The project uses the [LibraryService](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/monticore/EmbeddedMontiArc/simulators/commons/blob/master/src/main/java/commons/utils/LibraryService.java) system to make libraries stored inside the jar resources available at runtime (depending on the system).

### C++ dependencies

The libraries required by the C++ project are included and built by the CMake of the hardware_emulator.

Under Linux, the unicorn library is actually just wrapped in a CMake interface. On changes it has to be built using its make script.

## Test

The `hardware-emulator-test` can be executed in the hardware_emulator/bin folder locally to test the emulation of sample programs and a basic autopilot emulation.

# Outdated documentation, TODO update and put in the 'simulation wiki'

The main interface for a simulator is [SoftwareSimulator](src/main/java/de/rwth/monticore/EmbeddedMontiArc/simulators/hardware_emulator/interfaces/SoftwareSimulator.java).

Depending on whether the usage of the SoftwareSimulator is remote or not, it has to be allocated through a different instance of a [SoftwareSimulatorManager](src/main/java/de/rwth/monticore/EmbeddedMontiArc/simulators/hardware_emulator/interfaces/SoftwareSimulatorManager.java): `DirectSoftwareSimulatorManager` or `RemoteSoftwareSimulatorManager`. The remote version will return a RMI reference to the remote simulator.

## Details

This project is build from the following main components:

![Project Structure](docs/Structure.svg)

The components used to discover the ports of a *DynamicInterface* software and responsible for the communication between the MontiSim simulator and the software are shown in the following:

![Port Structure](docs/PortStructureVert.svg)

The main idea is to discover the name and types of the ports (performed by the `DynamicInterfaceResolver`), to store these informations in `PortInformation` structures, then depending on the actual simulator implementation used, allocate actual `Port` instances that can store and transfer the specific data type (`PortSimpleIntDirect`, `PortArrayIntEmu`, ...).

The templated `PortSimple` and `PortArray` implementations already define how the port communicates with the Java simulator (through JNI), but how the port data is given to the software is depending on how the software is loaded (as native library or in the Computer emulation), which is specified in the variants `Port...Emu` and `Port...Direct`.


## Emulator configuration

The [emulator_configuration](docs/emulator_configuration.pdf) document shows the configuration possibilities for the autopilot emulators.

## HardwareEmulator JNI interface

The interface of between the RMIModelServer and the HardwareEmulator works with _Java Native Interface (JNI)_. In case of an update
of the interface (file: [src/main/java/simulator/integration/HardwareEmulatorInterface.java](src/main/java/simulator/integration/HardwareEmulatorInterface.java)),
the corresponding C header has to be generated.

Currently, this happens in the [hardware_emulator](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/monticore/EmbeddedMontiArc/simulators/hardware_emulator) project under the `jni` folder,
where the HardwareEmulatorInterface.java has to be copied. `generate.bat` shows how to update the interface on Windows.

The java file has to be adapted to compile without its dependencies, since the JNI header will only
be generated from compilable java files. Since the actual header file only depends on the `native` functions from the java file, the other dependencies can
be safely deleted. The resulting header file then has to be renamed `emulator_server.h` and placed in the `hardware_emulator/src/emulator` source folder.
The corresponding implementations of the C interface have to be updated in `hardware_emulator/src/emulator/emulator_server.cpp`.

A better approach would be a script in the RMIModelServer project generating the header and copying it to the *hardware_emulator* project.

## New autopilot EMA port types

To communicate with the ports from the autopilot, an _AutopilotAdapter_ encapsulates the EMA model. For new port data types,
the *EMAM2CPP* generator and the *hardware_emulator* have to be updated to handle the new data type.

In the EMAM2CPP project, the `de.monticore.lang.monticar.generator.cpp.viewmodel.AutopilotAdapterDataModel` class is responsible to create the _AutopilotAdapter_.
In its `addInput` and `addOutput` functions, the new function definition and declarations for the data type have to be defined.

In the *hardware_emulator* projects, three places require updates for new data types.
 1. The `hardware_emulator/src/emulator/function_values.h / .cpp` files need to updated with the new data type (`enum class VALUE_TYPE`), buffer entry (`struct FunctionValue`) and type name (`FunctionValue::get_type()`).
 2. The `call_input()` and `call_output()` functions from the `HardwareEmulator` structure (`hardware_emulator/src/emulator/hardware_emulator.h`) must be updated. They need to know how to pass the arguments to the emulated autopilots.
 3. The `Java_simulator_integration_HardwareEmulatorInterface_add_1one_1input()` and `Java_simulator_integration_HardwareEmulatorInterface_query_1outputs()` functions need to know how to pass and read port data to and from Java. (`hardware_emulator/src/emulator/emulator_server.h`)
 
## Unsupported autopilot functionalities.

The emulator used in this RMIModelServer only implements features encountered in previous autopilots.

New autopilots might trigger new unsupported features:
 * Unsupported system calls (enable `debug=unsupported_syscalls` flag for the autopilot emulator). These are operating system functions for which no current emulation is implemented. These have to be added and registered in the `hardware_emulator/src/os_linux/linux_calls.h / .cpp` files for Linux and in the `hardware_emulator/src/os_windows/windows_calls.h / .cpp` files for Windows.
 * Unsupported instruction time value. The time table (currently `hardware_emulator/src/timetable/skylake.txt`) describing the number of CPU cycles for every instruction is manually filled. It currently only contains entries (!=0) for encountered instructions. It can be filled with elements from the `hardware_emulator/docs/instruction_time.txt` file (which contains entries from the instruction_tables.pdf file).
 
To make sure the autopilot emulation is correct, allocate an autopilot emulator with the `test_real` flag. When loading an autopilot with the same OS as the RMIModelServer, the emulator will compare the outputs of the emulated autopilot with the outputs of the actual autopilot program.
