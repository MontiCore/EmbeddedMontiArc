amd_full_table_with_hardcoded_values.table
- contains all the mnemonics supported by Zydis
- mnemonics, whose latency values are specified in AMD developer documents, have valid(?) latency.
- other mnemonics have latency cycle "-1", which indicates an "undefined" value
- the latency of endbr64 and jmp-related instructions are hardcoded according to the references on internet

amd_full_table_with_undefined_values.table
- same as the "amd_full_table_with_hardcoded_values.table", but no undefined values are hardcoded

amd_table_not_full.table
- first table created
- using this table will result in wrong time estimation from hardware emulator since:
    - this table includes a lot less instruction then the Zydis supports, so the indexes are not correct
