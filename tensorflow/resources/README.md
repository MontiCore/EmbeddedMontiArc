# Udacity Data generation

- This readme describes the geration of the test and train sets we used. 
- Predefined datasets can be downloaded [here](https://rwth-aachen.sciebo.de/apps/files/?dir=/LabSS19/end2end_training_testing_data&fileid=1993075326) 
    - among them are hdf5 files which can be used directly for training and testing. 
        - lables describe the resolution of images the saved in them. (Adjust neuronal network acordingly) 
    - there are also files which contain the extracted data from udacity. On it the jpg2hdf5 script can be exectuted (see section usage on how to do that).
    - contact kusmenko@se-rwth.de to get access to training and testing files
- Otherwise download the udacity data yourself and extract it (see section udacity data download).
- The result should be a file named train.h5 and test.h5. Place them into the training_data folder. After that proceed as described in the root Readme.

## Udacity data download 

The raw data, which needs to be first prerpocessed and then turned into an hdf5 file format, such that it can be used in training,  can be downloaded here https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/tree/master/datasets . In our experiments we used the Challenge 2 Driving Data. 
Follow the download instructions and use the Udacity Reader tool to extract the .bag files.


## Usage of jpg2hdf5.py script 

The script can be found in the folder data_transform_script

The script has 3 stages:
 - The first step parses image ids to steering ids. The id  specifies the time when the measurment was done. However, images and steering are measured at different times. Thereby, requring nearest neighbour matching.
 - The second step creates based on the specified flag a selection of images
 - The thrid step creates a hdf5 file called train.h5.  Because of high frame rates we select only each third image to avoid to similar images and therefore reduce overfitting. 

To achive these steps a number of csv files are generated and can be reviewed. 

|  | Flags | Description 
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | -h | help | 
| 2 | -i path | path = path to folder in which there is a folder named center containing all images and a csv file named steering.csv containing associated angles. (udacity extraction format) | 
| 3 | -a | Set this flag in order to generate hdf5 file based on all images | 
| 4 | -c | Set this flag in order to generate hdf5 file containing only images represeting the beginning and end of curves | 
| 5 | -l | Set this flag in order to generate hdf5 file containing only images represeting straight driving | 
| 6 | -s float | Set this flag in order to generate hdf5 file containing  in which the specified float specifies the percentage of how much the straigth driving the data contains. The rest of the data is curve driving. Make sure that the percentage does not exceed 0.5. | 
| 7 | -n int | specifies number of training images used (default all images in center)| 
| 8 | -t | use this flag to generate testing data scince it has different format than the training data | 


- The -i flag is mandatory scince it specifies the path to the folder containg the images (needs to be named center) and the steering csv (needs to be named steering.csv).
    - In addition exactly one of the following flags has to be set (-a,-c,-l,-s)
- Optional: set the -n flag to specify how many images should be taken. 
- Use the -i and -t flag for generating testing data from images based on the udacity_ch02 challange dataset. 
    - The reason is that they changed the structure of this specific dataset. 
- Note: Image resolution is hard coded to 120/180.
    - Change:  PIXEL_WIDTH  = int(640/4) and PIXEL_HEIGHT = int(480/4) in the script to change that. 

## Examples 
- python jpg2hdf5.py -i ../test_set/ -n 100 -a
    - assumption: script is executed inside data_transform_script
    - generates: train.h5 containg 100% of the data inside transfrom_script which are 100 pictures. That means the generated h5 files contains floor(100/3) images.
    - Note: If you try using -c, be aware that there might not be curves in the dataset 

- python jpg2hdf5.py -i ./ -s 0.2
    - assumtion: script is inside a folder containing  the center/ folder with images and  steering.csv
    - generates: train.h5 containing 20% straight driving and 80% curves and saves it to working directory

To generate test.h5 simply use this script and rename the associated file.
