From /home/felixh/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/init_ops.py:1251: calling __init__ (from tensorflow.python.ops.init_ops) with dtype is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Call initializer instance with the dtype argument instead of passing it to the constructor
`period` argument is deprecated. Please use `save_freq` to specify the frequency in number of samples seen.
From /home/felixh/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/math_grad.py:1250: where (from tensorflow.python.ops.array_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use tf.where in 2.0, which has the same broadcast rule as np.where
